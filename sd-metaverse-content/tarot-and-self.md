# Tarot & the Self  ðŸš§under constructionðŸš§

### Preface

How is Tarot related to knowledge of the Self? The Tarot has loaded and charged symbolic images \(or pages from the Book of Toth\) on each card to help you understand your unconscious - you inner Self - more clearly. When a querent chooses a card, it is their unconscious communicating with their conscious mind, shedding light on their life â€“ past, present or future. Depending on the imagery of each card drawn and how all of the cards in a spread relate to one another, they can give us different perspectives about what weâ€™re going through, what weâ€™re processing, and so on.  Meaningful communication is happening between your conscious mind and your inner Self.
