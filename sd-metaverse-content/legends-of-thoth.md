  * creator of math, calendar, hieroglyphs 
  * his temple is famous for a huge library hidden in endless catacombs _(pop reference: Asimovs Foundation & Empire :_The Salvor Hardin Museum of Origins_ on Terminus!) _of mysterious papyrus scrolls written by Thoth himself; holding all knowledge & wisdom of the world
* During Hellenism Thoth was transmuted into Hermes Trismegistus - the threefold wise (more myth than god)

### Trismegistus and the Hermetic Tradition
