In **** his right hand holding a white staff up high and the left hand pointing towards earth.

A lying eight hovering overhead, a white headband, a belt has the form of a serpent biting its own tail.&#x20;

A thick flower garden at feet with red roses and lilies, a massive wooden table in front and four objects on it: a sword a disk with a pentagram, a cup and wand.

### Symbols & Imagery Analysis (What is represented)

Lemniskate Symbol for new beginning;&#x20;

#### Four objects (magical tools or weapons): The Wand

**The wand** enhances strength of the hand or the arm, one can lean on it or it can be used as a weapon or baton. Take a branch for example, no one is straight in nature all are bent and have buds sprouting - not just giving strength but having it inherent. If it’s a creative or destructive strength/force depends on the hand holding/wielding the wand.

The wand is a symbol for the idea of strength like the phallus or the ship mast or tree trunk. What forces best communicate the image of the wand? The fire and the sexual forces. The magician is also holding up a white staff, with two pointy ends (see the high priestess for further reference!).

#### Cup

Not dynamic expansive and extroverted but containing, sheltering, safeguarding and introverted. Positioned almost opposite to the wand.&#x20;

**THOUGHT EXPERIMENT\_** Imagine holding a cup in the hand and feeling what it feels like handling it. When filled to the rim and further it flows over pushes outwards, the cup gives what was contained for a while. Meditate on that experience.

Like giving birth, it’s purely feminine. The force best describing it is the element water.

#### Sword

Function and form is similar to the staff, both are weapons that enhance strength of the arms. While the staff is very close to nature and every branch from any tree can be fashioned into a wand, the sword has a more complex refinement process. It’s fashioned from iron respectively raw iron in nature. This requires knowledge and skills of resource extraction. The staff is a living growth process, the sword is a product of forces and energy that where working from outside on to raw iron. The sword becomes a symbol for a force working the effects from outside into an object and change the position or form of it.  But the sword is also used to cut and divide not just take and conquer. from the smith comes both tools, and the magical mechanism is to separate the wheat from the grain, divide and order the matter. The sword points to the intellectual and mental force of the human thinking functions, like analysing, ordering and dividing.

The corresponding element is air, the sword converts to the mind what is not bodily, one can’t see neither only their impact or their working: music, architecture, texts, the wind rustling in the trees, dunes in the desert.

**MEDITATION EXERCISE\_** in German "Geist" (engl.: ghost) means mind. Think about how a ghost is like air or mind.

#### Disc/coins

Corresponding element is earth, palpable, "thick" material; take a coin in your hand feel its weight squeeze it, you can feel the hardness.

The five point star on the disk is the symbol of unity of elements with each point representing one element, the upward tip symbolises aether or theosophical speaking Akasha.

#### _The Esoteric Experience_

The four elements are magical tools given to the magician for him to work with. Not periodic, chemical elements, those are the primordial parts of matter. What is meant by elements are primordial parts of our complete world, the Cosmos, the whole cosmic experience.&#x20;

The esoteric experiences the universe and all cosmic events as an interplay of force(s) and her manifestations. The four elements are an expression of said force(s).&#x20;

Also true for the element earth, take a stone for example think about what makes it a stone, feel the weight and hardness, what keeps it from dissolving into parts? There is apparently a force contained that makes it into what it is.

To understand Tarot is to learn to see the world one is living in as an expression of an interplay of forces, maybe different expressions or forms of the same force?&#x20;

**Meditation Exercise\_** Go outside and see, experience the forces, search for water, fire, air and earth in nature. Afterwards see how these elements are working within you!&#x20;

The **earth** - a body the shelter the mask, the flesh. **Water** - the nerves the arteries. **Air** - The brain or the mind and **fire** the urge to grow. But they are never clearly distinguishable and possibly different for each individual. There’s no exact plan or blueprint of nature only similes to show the unified force coming into play with elements to conjure myriads of forms.



The posture of the magician is upright like the staff in this hand signalling force of creation - the fire or phallic force. The image of a man just after realising in his self and that he can accomplish anything with the tools provided a very male human aspect of life. Recognise how the I (also known as “the creative word”) looks like a staff itself. The two endpoints of the staff in his hand and the two colours of his garment show that the force is available can be both positive or negative, corresponding to the law of polarity both are in and around you just two forms of existence of the same force. For example one day is half light and half night.&#x20;
