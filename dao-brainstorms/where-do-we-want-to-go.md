# Where do we want to go ?

Our goal is to start with a "stewardship" layer for an artist focused Distributed Cooperative \(DisCo\).

* some other form of governance.
* Distribution of "decision power" is on a "sweat equity" basis; not on a financial basis. With the ability to evolve in order to account for advance/binding votes that consider merit/expertise when applying voting power.
* Progress organically from soft protocols/loosely coupled to tightly coupled decision making.
