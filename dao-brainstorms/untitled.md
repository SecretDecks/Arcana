We are a group of loosely organized individuals seeking to form an Autonomous Distributed Cooperative \(ADisCO\) through the experience of introducing the Tarot to paradigm shifting NFT technology. 

As well as offering educational material and an app ecosystem for enhanced self reflection and knowledge. In order to empower creative individuals spiritually and economically.
