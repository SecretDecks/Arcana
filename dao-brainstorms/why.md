For a distributed community to be sustainable it must define how it governs itself clearly and transparently.

At first, we will steward Secret Decks towards this goal by building a tool set that:

* Will formalize an egalitarian merit-based decision-making process.
* Will build pathways that resolve conflict through consensus.
* Will ensure that our humanity is not obscured by automation.
* Will allow for iteration and evolution.
