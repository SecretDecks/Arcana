# The DisCo

## We are a distributed cooperative, [DisCo](https://disco.coop/manifesto/) for short.

### TL;DR:

DisCo is a more human focused spin on a DAO, decentralised autonomous organisation. Tracking also intangible contributions like community care work and distributing (voting) power on a merit based way.
