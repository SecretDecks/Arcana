# TAROT Pool Incentive Design

#### The number one reason besides supporting the SecretDecks mission is to receive personal Tarot readings!

* Access to a reading is granted with a _**READINGS NFTicket.**_&#x20;
* Delegators with stake above 100k will receive a **NFticket** every 6 epochs_**.**_
* All other delegators are able to exchange 33 **TAROT** tokens for one _**READINGS NFTicket.**_

All information on how to access the reading will be contained within the NFTicket.

A setup guide for the wallet registration will be available by end of February.

### How to get TAROT tokens!

**Anyone** that stakes **above 78 ADA** with TAROT is eligible for the TAROT token!\
The amount of tokens increases in a Fibonacci like sequence:
