# ðŸ’  Mindfulness Policy

We entertain the idea that this planet is a living organism, a holistic system - made of many decentralised parts - that strives for balance and sustainability from chaos, in order to create symbiotic, more efficient and less intrusive forms of life.

### **We value life over profit** In order to live in harmony with this planet, we will always **favour**:

* **Building** on sovereign grade censorship resistant systems, offering data- and **self-sovereignty** for good actors, over centralised, censorable systems.
* **Creating a harmonious habitat**, blending in and supporting synergies with the environment, over zero sum games.
* **Complementing**, over controlling the **environment and individual**.
* **Embracing** new technologies and **fresh thought** processes, over conserving faulty systems.
* **Open source ideas** and build loyalty coalitions and teams (infosets/Holons), over proprietary code and hierarchical companies.
* **Preserving**, over extracting **resources** from the environment or individuals. Growing networks, over enterprises.

### When engaging with one another or other entities we will always favour:

* **Cooperating**, over competing.
* **Fluidity** over conformity.
* **Love**, over fear.
* **Sustainability** over quick profit
* **Solutioning**, over discussing problems.
* Game B over Game A

## Footnotes

[Game A](https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=Game\_A) & [Game B](https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=Game\_B) from the [Game B wiki](https://www.gameb.wiki/)

* Game A is primarily characterized by scarcity and thus rivalrous or win-lose dynamics; a kind of predatory capitalism
* Game B is the flag on the hill for an omni-win civilization that maximizes human flourishing

## Appendix

_**This Mindfulness Policy is the primer for the organisation charter**_

1. It's recommended as the **only obligation** for members of any Distributed Cooperative (DisCo) to read the Policy (and Charter) carefully and subsequently sign  with a comment and adhere to it.
2. Changing the Policy or Charter is possible if all founding members see it necessary (and can be done only prior to the **Genesis Event** of any DisCo).
